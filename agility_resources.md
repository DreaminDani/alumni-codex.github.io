# Agility Resources

## Practices

### From VMW/Tanzu

[Tanzu Practices][tp] site - This is a VMware officially sanctioned "Open Sourced" how-to guides, including templates to various sessions and practices. [Pivot Joe Moore's][joe] main job is to manage this site. Email him if you want content added.

[The Anchor Playbook][anchor] - An oft-requested guide, also published by VMware.

[The Pivotal Glossary][gloss], blog post by Megan Holzer from 2017, migrated forward to tanzu.vmware.com. It's "A guide to the language, idioms, and acronyms (oh, my!) that we use to develop modern software"

### From Others 

Atlassian has published something similar called the [Atlassian Playbooks][atlassian]. There is some overlap with what we used a Pivotal. Many good things here, complete with templates for Atlassian Products

When making the arguments for weekly iterations, take a look at [
Agile Software Planning: What to do if Classic 2-Week Sprint Planning isn't Working][2weeks]
