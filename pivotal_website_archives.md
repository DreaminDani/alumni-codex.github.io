  - Interestings:
    - "Interestings" was originally "Interesting Things" (see the blog)
    - We used to track how long standup took each day. In 2007 it looks like the norm was 15-20 minutes, which seems long by modern standards!
    - "Iteration. It doesn't mean going over the same thing again and again â€” it means biting off small pieces and letting one good thing build upon the next." (from the Pivotal Process page)
