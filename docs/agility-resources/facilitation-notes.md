**Team Health Assessments**

    Do What’s Right
    - One voice at a time
    - Practice being present
    - Discussion is private and non-attributable
    - Respect the breaks
    - Feel free to speak your mind
    
    Do What Works
    - Focus on this meeting
    - Stay single threaded
    - Exaggerate your video presence
    
    Be Kind
    - Speak from the “I” perspective
    - Listen deeply enough to be changed
    - “Yes, and …” over “Yes, but …”
    - Feedback and questions are welcome
