# Pivotal Alumni Codex

A place for the links to the things we wish we'd taken with us.

This is a collection of interesting links and docs to help us after Pivotal.
It's a wiki as a workaround for searching and/or paying for Slack as a full
archive.

This is a static site, generated from a set of Markdown files in the [Alumni Codex repository](https://github.com/alumni-codex/alumni-codex.github.io) at [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you want to add anything or make any changes, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
Once you have one, you can fork, edit, and submit a pull request. See the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/alumni-codex/alumni-codex.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository for more details.

If this is daunting, reach out to Davis (@DWF on the Slack) and he'll help you out.
