# Pivotal Alumni Codex

A place for the links to the things we wish we'd taken with us.

This is a collection of interesting links and docs to help us after Pivotal.
It's a wiki as a workaround for searching and/or paying for Slack as a full
archive.

If you want to add anything or make any changes, you will need a Google Account.
Once you have one, [email DWF](mailto:dwfrank+codex@gmail.com) , or ask in the
\#general channel, and ask for edit access. (hint: you will always get access)
